# 🌸 Movie Watchlist App  

> A simple, responsive web app that lets users search for movies, add them to a personal watchlist, and remove them when watched — all saved in localStorage.

## 🪞 Overview  
This project is a web application that allows users to manage their own movie watchlist:  

- **Problem it solves:** Keeps track of movies you want to watch in one place without needing an account.  
- **Target audience:** Movie enthusiasts who want a simple, lightweight watchlist.  
- **Unique aspect:** All movies are saved locally in the browser, allowing for persistent watchlists without server-side storage.  

The app dynamically fetches movie details from the OMDb API, displays them in a clean UI, and allows users to add or remove movies easily.
